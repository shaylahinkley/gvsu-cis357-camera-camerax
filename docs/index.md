# Overview

This is a demonstration application to get familiar with Android [Camera](https://developer.android.com/training/camera)/[Camerax](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax). 
The demonstration assumes that the user has a basic understanding of coding in Kotlin in Android Studio.

## My Progress App

This application is used to track progress of crafts, buildings, weightloss, and so much more, just in pictures. This application allows users to take images with their Android enabled device and import them into the application. The images are sorted by date allowing users to easily see the beginning "before" picture and the end "after" picture.


# Getting started

In order to setup the "My Progress App", you will need a few things including:
