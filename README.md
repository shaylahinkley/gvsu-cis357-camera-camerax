# Overview
This project was created for Grand Valley State Unversity's course in Mobile Development in the Fall of 2020. It is a step-by-step tutorial of a certain area of mobile development.
  
Our group chose Android's Camera/Camerax to make a demonstration application that others can follow along to in order to grasp a basic understanding of using a camera in Android Studio
using the Kotlin Language.
